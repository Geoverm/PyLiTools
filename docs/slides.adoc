= Python &#9829; INTERLIS
:revealjs_theme: simple
:source-highlighter: highlight.js

== Three flavours

* Jython
* GraalPy
* Shared Libs with Python Bindings

== Requirements 

* Linux or macOS
* Windows: WSL2 or something similar (e.g. Multipass)
* Clone repo: `https://github.com/edigonzales/pylitools-ws-20231122.git`

== Python loves INTERLIS, but...

* it still has something to do with Java ;)
* especially the ecosystem (e.g. tooling) can be confusing (for Python programmers)
* it focuses on writing Python code and integrating existing INTERLIS tools

== Jython

* Implementation of Python in Java
* Runs on the JVM
* Has access to Java classes / libraries

=== Pro

* Easy to access Java classes
* Some tooling exists (e.g. Jip)

=== Con

* Python 2.7
* Everything seems to be outdated
* Start up time

== GraalPy

== Shared Libs with Python Bindings
